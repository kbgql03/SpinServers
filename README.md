# SpinServers Promo Codes and Latest SpinServers Dedicated Server Deals for 2026

## SpinServers Introduction

Picture this: you're running a growing business and need a server that won't eat your entire IT budget. That's where SpinServers comes in. Founded in 2018 but backed by decades of hardware expertise through their parent company MET International (established 1994), SpinServers made a smart bet—what if dedicated servers didn't have to cost a fortune?

They're based in the Dallas-Fort Worth area and operate as a wholesale provider of instant and custom dedicated servers across the United States. Their tagline "spin up servers fast, seamlessly, and affordably" isn't just marketing talk. The company actually delivers on instant provisioning—many customers report their servers going live in under 30 minutes.

What makes them different? SpinServers is vertically integrated with a hardware reseller, meaning they treat servers as assets rather than expenses. This setup allows them to offer enterprise-grade Intel Xeon configurations at prices that typically run 30-50% below traditional hosting providers. They operate two primary data center locations: Dallas, Texas and San Jose, California (Silicon Valley), with the San Jose location specifically optimized for Asia-Pacific connectivity.

Their core offerings include:
- Instant dedicated servers with auto-provisioning
- Custom server builds tailored to specific needs
- 10Gbps and 40Gbps unmetered bandwidth options
- KVM VPS hosting for smaller deployments
- Colocation services with under 24-hour setup
- Hosted private cloud solutions

All servers come standard with IPMI/iKVM access, full root access, IPv4 and IPv6 allocation, and the ability to auto-install Linux, Windows, or ESXi. One standout feature customers rave about is their VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) connectivity, which allows easy L2 network configuration between multiple servers—a game-changer for complex deployments.

The company maintains 24/7 support and operates Tier 3 data centers that meet HIPAA, PCI, and SOC 2 standards. Their network blend includes premium carriers like Cogent, Hurricane Electric, Level 3, and Equinix IX, ensuring solid connectivity and low latency.
